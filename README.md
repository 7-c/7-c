## 🔎 Executive Summary

**Strategic architect of secure digital systems. Relentless adversary in red team operations.**  
With over a decade of experience at the intersection of software engineering and cybersecurity, I specialize in the full lifecycle of system design, threat emulation, and binary deconstruction. Holding industry-standard certifications (OSCP, CISSP, AWS Solutions Architect), I bring a unique blend of development rigor and adversarial insight—building resilient architectures while simultaneously stress-testing them under real-world offensive scenarios.

My operational philosophy blends deep technical acumen with a security-first mindset, ensuring every system I touch is fortified against both common exploits and nation-state-grade threats.
