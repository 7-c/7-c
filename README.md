## 🔎 Executive Summary

Strategic engineer at the intersection of software development and adversarial security. I combine full-stack engineering discipline with hands-on offensive research and reverse engineering to design resilient systems and responsibly evaluate their weaknesses.

Background: B.Sc. in Computer Science (Islamic University, Faculty of Science & Arts) with internship experience in cybersecurity, full-stack development, and networking. I practice and advocate ethical, authorized security testing and responsible disclosure.
